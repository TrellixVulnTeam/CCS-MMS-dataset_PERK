# CCS-MMS dataset
A dataset designed to tackle the Combined Complementary Supplementary Multi-Modal Summarization (CCS-MMS) problem proposed in 'Multi-Modal Supplementary-Complementary Summarization using Multi-Objective Optimization'.

Since the developed dataset is an extension of the [MMS dataset](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/ZhangPublications/emnlp_en.htm) proposed by Li. et al [2], we've provided the steps to obtain our dataset.

Steps to follow to obtain the dataset:
* Step-1: Obtain the MMS dataset by filling up the application form provided at http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/ZhangPublications/emnlp_en.htm.
* Step-2: Run the `convert_nomenclature.py` file by using the following command:
```
python3 /path/to/mms_data/zip/file /path/to/new/data/directory
```
* Step-3: Refer to the `labels.csv` file containing the outputs extracted by annotation process described in [1]. 

If you use this dataset, we appreciate that you can cite our paper as well as the original paper by Li et al. [2].
